# Piano Application (Android) - README

## Overview
This is a simple piano application for Android, developed using **Kotlin**. The app allows users to interact with a virtual piano by pressing on-screen keys to produce musical sounds. The project aims to provide an intuitive and responsive experience for users who want to explore music or just have fun.

## Features
- **Interactive Piano Keys**: Users can press the keys on the virtual piano to play corresponding musical notes.
- **Clean and Simple UI**: The interface is minimalistic, designed for ease of use without any distractions.
- **Responsive Sound**: Each key press triggers a sound, simulating a real piano experience.
- **Multi-touch Support**: Users can press multiple keys simultaneously to play chords.

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Kotlin
- **Framework**: Android SDK
- **Sound Library**: Custom implementation or third-party library for sound playback (e.g., `MediaPlayer` or `SoundPool`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AvizovAuez/piano-app.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the application on your Android device or emulator.

## Usage
- Open the app.
- Press any key on the piano to hear the sound corresponding to that note.
